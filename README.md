Click on the star to support this project

The StarRise Framework is designed with a focus on quality, performance, and maintainability, serving as a robust foundation for quickly developing PHP projects.

Routing
StarRise Framework incorporates the powerful routing capabilities provided by Pecee Simple Router. This allows for efficient and flexible handling of HTTP requests and enables you to create and manage your project's routes effortlessly.

Template System
The framework integrates the Twig template engine through Twig, providing a reliable and feature-rich system for creating and rendering templates. The mustache symbol {{ }} (double curly braces) is used to open and close templates within your project.

Database Configuration
To configure your database, create an .env file and input your database details, following the template from .env.example. You can define any variables in the .env file to store passwords or sensitive data securely.

If you prefer not to configure the database manually, the framework provides the Book class, allowing you to save data without the need for explicit database configuration.

The framework follows a structured file organization:

APP: Contains all backend features.
Resources: Houses frontend HTML, JS, and CSS features.

Basic layers of MVC, including controllers, models, and routing/HTTP requests (http). Define your project's routes in the Routes directory.
